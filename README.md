# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
   
### Simulator. You can download the Term3 Simulator BETA which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 50 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Reflection

## Path Generation

Main classes that solve the path planner solution are Vehicle, Machine and Controller 
which are instantiated in `src/main.ccp (lines 202-211`). The instance of the Vehicle class is passed to the onMessage
handler which receives traffic position and velocity information from the simulator every 0.02 seconds.

Vehicle and traffic information is transformed into the instance of Measurement class and passed to vehicle by methods
`Vehicle::UpdateEgoData(...)` and `Vehicle::UpdateTrafficData(...)` in `src/main.cpp (lines 255-286)`.

Based on the information received, current state of the vehicle and rules of the road, vehicle plans the path in
`src/main.cpp (line 288)` by calling `Vehicle::PlanPath()` function. Controller contains information about
the target speed and lane.
 
After target speed and lane are set trajectory is generated by calling `Vehicle::GenerateTrajectory()` function 
which returns 50 points in world coordinates which are passed back to the simulator and can be see as a green line
`src/main.cpp (lines 290-293)` in the simulator.

### Plan Path

Basic behaviour of the path planner is defined by unit tests in `vehicle_tests.cpp (lines 58-158)`.

* TEST(Vehicle, Should_AlwaysDriveOnTheRightSideOfTheRoad) 
* TEST(Vehicle, Should_PreferToDriveInLeftLane_When_ThereIsNoTraffic)
* TEST(Vehicle, Should_OvertakeOnTheLeft_When_ThereIsNoTrafficOnTheLeftLane) 
* TEST(Vehicle, Should_OvertakeOnTheRight_When_ThereIsTrafficOnTheLeftLane) 
* TEST(Vehicle, Should_FollowVehicle_When_NotPossibleToOverTakeDueToTraffic) 
* TEST(Vehicle, Should_FollowVehicle_When_NotPossibleToOverTakeDueToSpeedLimit)
* TEST(Vehicle, Should_DriveSlightlySlowerThanTheSpeedLimit_When_InTheMiddleAndTheRightLane)

Rules or the road and road properties e.g. speed limit, number of lanes and lane width are
defined in Road class. Road has three lanes left, middle and right with identifiers 1, 2 and 3.
The width of the lane is 4m.

Possible states and state transitions of the state machine are defined in classes in `src/states` folder. 
Classes derived from State class defined in `src/states/state.h` define allowed states:

* ChangingLaneToLeftState
* ChangingLaneToRightState
* CruisingState
* FollowingState
* ReadyState

State transitions are defined by State class in `states/state.h`:
* State::ChangeLaneToLeft(...)
* State::ChangeLaneToRight(...)
* State::Cruise(...)
* State::Follow(...)
* State::Ready(...)

Allowed transitions are show on the following figure.

![State Machine](./images/state_machine.png)

Once state machine is active it will determine next best state by evaluating cost for all the possible state
transitions. State with smallest cost is chosen in `State::GoToNextBestState( )` function.

For each transition cost is evaluated in Cost class. The following costs are calculated:
* Cost::ChangeLaneCost( )
* Cost::CollisionCost( )
* Cost::DrivingTowardLeftSideCost( )

### Trajectory

Trajectory is generated in `Vehicle::GenerateTrajectory( )` function. Same solution was implemented
as in the project overview provided by Udacity on youtube channel.

Vehicle object contains vehicle position and orientation and highway way points. Highway points
are passed to the object during the initialization `main.cpp (line 207)`. Vehicle position and
orientation are being updated every time onMessage handler is called by `Vehicle::UpdateEgoData(...)`.

The lane and the speed of the vehicle are determined by the path planner.
 
Trajectory is generated by the help of spline library `lib/spline.h`. In order to generate the spline,
the spline way points has to be defined. First two way points W1 and W2 of the spline are determined by vehicle position in
world cartesian coordinates and yaw of the vehicle `vehicle.cpp (lines 111-137)`.

Next three way points are determined by using a helper function `Vehicle::getXY( )` which transforms Frenet (s,d)
to Cartesian (x,y) coordinates.

![Trajectory Generation](./images/trajectory_generation.png)

s of the vehicle is known, d is defined by path planner. The next three way points are calculated as:

* W3 = getXY(s + 30m, d)
* W4 = getXY(s + 60m, d)
* W5 = getXY(s + 90m, d)

Way points in world coordinates system are then transformed into local vehicle coordinate system to
simplify math and eliminate yaw angle `vehicle.cpp (lines 153-160)`. 

Spline is fitted through five way points `vehicle.cpp (line 166)`.

50 points are generated on the fitted spline and transformed back into the world coordinates
 `vehicle.cpp (line 176-203)`.

4. Run it: `./path_planning`.
5. Run tests: `./test/runUnitTests`

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
